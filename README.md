# Small ML language (SMLL) 

<div align="center"> 
    <p> A small, experimental, general purpose programming language created for exploring alternative ways of writing applications on the JVM </p>
</div>

![example workflow](https://github.com/hexaredecimal/ML/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

# What is needed to run this?
> The latest JAVA compiler (with support for java 21 source input)
> A rust compiler


```ml
using System::Io

fun main(): Unit => println("Hello, world")
```


# Features:
- Type inference for variables
- Variant enums
- structs 
- No Implicit OOP (No inheritence, no interfaces, only data and data alone)
- Expressions not Statements


# Inspiration:

>>> SMLL is a ml derived language for the JVM which borrows a lot of concepts from languages such as 
Standard ML, Rust and Kotlin.
